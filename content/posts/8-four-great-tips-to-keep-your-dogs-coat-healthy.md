A healthy coat is a sign of a healthy dog. A shiny coat means your dog is getting proper maintenance, diet, and they are healthy on the inside. Every dog owner spends more money than they should on dog shampoos to make their pooch’s coat shine. But what they don’t understand is that a healthy coat doesn’t just depend on a good shampoo, there are a lot of factors that go into it.

Here are some tips to keep your dog’s coat healthy

Brushing your dog’s coat every day without fail is crucial. Apart from removing the old hairs, brushing also helps the oil in their skin to be circulated around the dog’s coat. Use the specially designed dog brushes that are right for the your dog’s coat type and not the human hair brushes.

## 2 - Add protein and Omega-3 to your dog’s diet

Just like human hair, dog’s hairs are also 90% protein. That is why, to maintain a healthy coat, your dog needs to get the right amount of protein in their diet. At the same time, your dog also needs omega-3 to build immunity against skin diseases..

When buying dog food, go for the ones that have protein as the first ingredient and there is also a good amount of Omega-3 fatty acids in them.

## 3 - A little oil can go a long way

Instead of directly giving your dog a bath, use a natural oil to condition their coat first. You can use organic coconut oil to give your dog a massage, which they will definitely enjoy and then let them sit out in the sun for about an hour to get the oil to absorb in their skin. After that, just give your dog a bath like you always do.Instead of directly giving your dog a bath, use a natural oil to condition their coat first.

There is no word to describe that feeling you get when your dog is freshly bathed and smelling amazing. But you shouldn’t give your dog frequent baths just because they don’t smell fresh anymore. That is because giving frequent baths to dogs can turn their coat dry.

A general rule of thumb is to give your dog a bath once a month. You should only give your dog weekly baths if you have a dog like the Basset Hound with an oily skin.

With these simple tips, your dog’s coat will be healthy and shiny as ever.
