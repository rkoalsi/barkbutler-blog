Tejas Anton Keni is a fellow doggist and a content writer at Barkbutler. He is one of our resident writers and a dedicated pet parent. He is a father to a two-year-old labrador named Osiris; he takes care of his dog diligently and makes it a priority to better his days as his dog, does it for him. Keni uses his experiences of being a first-time and a newbie pet parent to make it a habit to write stories, articles and general tips and tricks trying to map it out better for people who are considering or just got a pet and don’t know how to be a better parent to it.
